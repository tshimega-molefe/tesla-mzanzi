# Neural Network-Based Taxi Collision Avoidance System

## Overview

This GitHub project focuses on developing a collision avoidance system for a simulated taxi using neural networks. The simulation incorporates realistic taxi movement and a sensor system that leverages neural networks to detect obstacles and make informed decisions for collision avoidance. The project follows best practices in software engineering, including modular code design, object-oriented programming, and efficient collision detection algorithms.

## Key Features

- **Neural Network Integration:** Utilizes neural networks for the collision avoidance system, allowing the taxi to learn and adapt its behavior based on environmental input.
- **Realistic Taxi Simulation:** Implements a realistic taxi simulation with dynamic movement, acceleration, and friction.
- **Sensor System:** Integrates a sensor system using raycasting to detect obstacles and provide input to the neural network.
- **Modular Design:** Adheres to modular design principles, enhancing code organization, maintainability, and extensibility.
- **Collision Detection Algorithm:** Implements an optimized algorithm for calculating intersections between line segments to determine potential collisions.
